# Optimization Digital Card Game Board

Thanks to the supervision, guidance, and support of Professor William Lassiter at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

**First, let me explain that `dcg` in the repository refers to `digital card game.` While our research will later use `Hearthstone` as a case study, I believe that our early examples are still highly applicable to the broader `mulligan problem` in various card games.**  

This is just a brief `introduction` to the overall project. For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the `README` file above, which includes descriptions in both `English` and `Simplified Chinese.`
