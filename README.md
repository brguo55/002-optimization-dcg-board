# Optimization Digital Card Game Board

Thanks to the supervision, guidance, and support of Professor William B. Lassiter at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

First, let me explain that `dcg` in the repository refers to `digital card game.` While our research will later use `Hearthstone` as a case study, I believe that our early optimization models are still highly applicable to the `board control` in various card games.

This is just a brief `introduction` to the overall project. For a more detailed intorduction, please refer to the `README` file above, which includes descriptions in both `English` and `Simplified Chinese.`
